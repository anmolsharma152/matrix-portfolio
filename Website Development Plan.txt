    Effects:

        Glitchy text & elements (CSS animations or JavaScript-based)

        Scrolling animations (GSAP or Intersection Observer API)

        CRT scanline effect (CSS filters, SVG overlays, or Three.js for depth)

        Terminal-style prompts & fake commands (JS interactions)

        Background matrix rain effect (Canvas animation or WebGL)

3. Structure & Sections

    Landing Page (Intro Section)

        Animated matrix rain background.

        "Access Granted" or "Welcome" typewriter effect.

        Terminal-style name intro with glitch effects.

    About Me

        Minimalistic section with animated neon line separators.

        Interactive terminal-like response system (input fake commands for bio details).

    Projects Showcase

        Interactive card-based or terminal-style project list.

        Hover/click animations with neon effects.

    Skills & Tech Stack

        Animated grid of tech logos with hover effects.

        Terminal-style progress bars for skill levels.

    Contact & Socials

        Hacking-style "contact terminal" where users type to reveal contact info.

        Interactive buttons with glitch animations.

4. Tech & Tools

    Frontend: Tailwind CSS, JavaScript (vanilla or React/Vue), GSAP for animations.

    Backend: Node.js (Express.js for minimal API if needed).

    Canvas/WebGL: For matrix effects & CRT-style rendering.

    Libraries:

        GSAP (for animations)

        Three.js (for 3D effects if needed)

        Anime.js (for glitch/motion effects)

5. Development Plan

    Set up project structure (folder setup, Tailwind config, initial HTML/CSS layout).

    Implement landing page with matrix rain effect & CRT-style intro.

    Build sections (About, Projects, Skills, Contact) one by one.

    Add interactivity & animations.

    Optimize for performance & responsiveness.

    Deploy on GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify.
